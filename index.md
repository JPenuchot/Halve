# ~jpenuchot

Computer geek who fell in love with music.

Currently working at the LRI (Laboratory of Research in Computer Science) near Paris as an intern. See my work [here](https://github.com/JPenuchot/boost.simd_playground). Otherwise I'm studying Computer Science at the Paris-Saclay University.

The rest of my work is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/JPenuchot), oh and I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SlymayerTV) where I do live music productions too.
