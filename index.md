Computer geek who fell in love with music.

Studying Computer Science at Paris-Saclay University. I also worked at the LRI (French Laboratory of Computer Science) where I did some benchmarking on [boost.simd](https://github.com/NumScale/boost.simd) by developing high-performance linear algebra kernel using only portable C++ code (thanks to boost.simd) that matched with OpenBLAS and MKL in terms of performance.

The rest of my work is available on :

- [GitHub](https://github.com/JPenuchot)
- [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/unkwnplyr)

This site runs on Tylan Talti's [Halve theme](https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Halve). Many thanks to him for providing a cool Jekyll theme so I don't have to learn web design.
