<p>Computer geek who fell in love with music.</p>

<p>Studying Computer Science at Paris-Saclay University. I also worked at the LRI (French Laboratory of Computer Science) where I did some benchmarking on [boost.simd](https://github.com/NumScale/boost.simd) by developing high-performance linear algebra kernel using only portable C++ code (thanks to boost.simd) that matched with OpenBLAS and MKL in terms of performance.</p>

<p>The rest of my work is available on :</p>
