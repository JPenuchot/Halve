##  Programming/Computer science experience

Most of my personal projects are available from my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/JPenuchot).

- C/C++

  Since 2009
  
  Good skills : Template meta-programming, high performance computing, assembly-level profiling, benchmarking... I had a 2 months internship at the LRI to work on [boost.simd](https://github.com/NumScale/boost.simd) (developed portable, basic linear algebra libraries that matched OpenBLAS' performance)

- CUDA

  Since 2012
  
  See [CUDASamples](https://github.com/JPenuchot/CUDA_Samples)

- OCaml

  During my 2nd, 3rd and 4th years at Paris-Sud University
  
  Along with Advanced Functional Programming and Compilation courses

- Java

  During my 2nd year at Paris-Sud University
  
  Along with Software Engineering courses

- C# at 11 y/o

  Only a first approach
