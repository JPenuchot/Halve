##  Programming/Computer science background

Most of my personal projects are available from my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/JPenuchot).

- **C/C++** - Advanced  
  Since 2009  
  Template-metaprogramming, good knowledge of the STL, worked on benchmarking [boost.SIMD](https://github.com/NumScale/boost.simd) for research

- **CUDA** - Good  
  (Self-taught at 16 and had lessons on it at the University)  
  See [CUDASamples](https://github.com/JPenuchot/CUDA_Samples)

- **OCaml** - Advanced  
  See [OCutTheRope](https://github.com/JPenuchot/OCutTheRope)

- **Java** - Average

- **C#** - Average  
  (First language I learnt when I was 11)

##  Past jobs

- Two internships at the **French Laboratory of Computer Science** as a member of the **Parallel Systems** research team, the first one resulted in my first research publication as **main author** with **Joël Falcou** and **Amal Khabou** (Modern Generative Programming Techniques for Optimizing Small Matrix-Vector Multiplication)

- **C/C++ Software Developper** at [FullScale Labs](http://www.fullscale-labs.com/index.php/) (Summer job after my first year at the University)  
  July 2015

- Waiter at l'Ermitage (On weekends)

## Hobbies

Mostly **music**, I **organized** Techno parties in parisian clubs and I **produce** a lot of music on my spare time. I also throw a few gigs here and there in France. I also do workout for health and work on side projects, most of which are available on my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/JPenuchot).
