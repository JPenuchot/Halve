<h2>Programming/Computer Science background</h2>

<p>
  Most of my personal projects are available from my
  <a href=https://github.com/JPenuchot>GitHub profile</a>.
</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    C/C++ - Very Advanced<br>
    Since 2009<br>
    Template-metaprogramming, good knowledge of the STL, worked on benchmarking
    <a href=https://github.com/NumScale/boost.simd>boost.SIMD</a> for research
    by developing generic high performance linear algebra kernels
  </li><br/>

  <li>
    CUDA - Good<br>
    (Self-taught at 16 and had lessons on it at the University)<br>
    See <a href=https://github.com/JPenuchot/CUDA_Samples>CUDASamples</a>
  </li><br/>

  <li>
    OCaml - Advanced<br>
    See <a href=https://github.com/JPenuchot/OCutTheRope>OCutTheRope</a>
  </li><br/>

  <li>
    Java - Average
  </li><br/>

  <li>

</ul>

<h2>Past jobs</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Two internships at the French Laboratory of Computer Science as a member
    of the <a href=https://parsys.lri.fr>(Parallel Systems) research team</a>,
    the first one resulted in my first research publication as main author
    with Joël Falcou and Amal Khabou (Modern Generative
    Programming Techniques for Optimizing Small Matrix-Vector Multiplication),
    which I presented at the HPCS2018.
  </li><br/>

  <li>
    C/C++ Software Developper at
    <a href=http://www.fullscale-labs.com/index.php>FullScale Labs</a>
    (Summer job after my first year at the University)<br>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<p>
  Mostly music, I organized Techno parties in parisian nightclubs
  and I produce a lot of music on my spare time. I also throw a few gigs
  here and there in France. I also do workout for health and work on
  side projects, most of which are available on my
